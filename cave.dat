35	YOU'RE AT A LOW WINDOW OVERLOOKING A HUGE PIT, WHICH EXTENDS UP OUT OF
35	SIGHT.	A FLOOR IS INDISTINCTLY VISIBLE OVER 50 FEET BELOW.  TRACES OF
35	WHITE MIST COVER THE FLOOR OF THE PIT, BECOMING THICKER TO THE RIGHT.
35	MARKS IN THE DUST AROUND THE WINDOW WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT
35	SOMEONE HAS BEEN HERE RECENTLY.  DIRECTLY ACROSS THE PIT FROM YOU AND
35	25 FEET AWAY THERE IS A SIMILAR WINDOW LOOKING INTO A LIGHTED ROOM.  A
35	SHADOWY FIGURE CAN BE SEEN THERE PEERING BACK AT YOU.

100	NARROW TUNNEL EXITS TO THE WEST.  A DARK CORRIDOR LEADS NE.
101	YOU'RE IN THE DARK-ROOM.  A CORRIDOR LEADING SOUTH IS THE ONLY EXIT.
102	YOU ARE IN AN ARCHED HALL.  A CORAL PASSAGE ONCE CONTINUED UP AND EAST
102	FROM HERE, BUT IS NOW BLOCKED BY DEBRIS.  THE AIR SMELLS OF SEA WATER.

108	YOU ARE AT WITT'S END.	PASSAGES LEAD OFF IN *ALL* DIRECTIONS.
109	YOU ARE IN A NORTH/SOUTH CANYON ABOUT 25 FEET ACROSS.  THE FLOOR IS
109	COVERED BY WHITE MIST SEEPING IN FROM THE NORTH.  THE WALLS EXTEND
109	UPWARD FOR WELL OVER 100 FEET.	SUSPENDED FROM SOME UNSEEN POINT FAR
109	ABOVE YOU, AN ENORMOUS TWO-SIDED MIRROR IS HANGING PARALLEL TO AND
109	MIDWAY BETWEEN THE CANYON WALLS.  (THE MIRROR IS OBVIOUSLY PROVIDED
109	FOR THE USE OF THE DWARVES, WHO AS YOU KNOW, ARE EXTREMELY VAIN.)  A
109	SMALL WINDOW CAN BE SEEN IN EITHER WALL, SOME FIFTY FEET UP.
110	YOU'RE AT A LOW WINDOW OVERLOOKING A HUGE PIT, WHICH EXTENDS UP OUT OF
110	SIGHT.	A FLOOR IS INDISTINCTLY VISIBLE OVER 50 FEET BELOW.  TRACES OF
110	WHITE MIST COVER THE FLOOR OF THE PIT, BECOMING THICKER TO THE LEFT.
110	MARKS IN THE DUST AROUND THE WINDOW WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT
110	SOMEONE HAS BEEN HERE RECENTLY.  DIRECTLY ACROSS THE PIT FROM YOU AND
110	25 FEET AWAY THERE IS A SIMILAR WINDOW LOOKING INTO A LIGHTED ROOM.  A
110	SHADOWY FIGURE CAN BE SEEN THERE PEERING BACK AT YOU.
111	A LARGE STALACTITE EXTENDS FROM THE ROOF AND ALMOST REACHES THE FLOOR
111	BELOW.	YOU COULD CLIMB DOWN IT, AND JUMP FROM IT TO THE FLOOR, BUT
111	HAVING DONE SO YOU WOULD BE UNABLE TO REACH IT TO CLIMB BACK UP.
112	YOU ARE IN A LITTLE MAZE OF TWISTING PASSAGES, ALL DIFFERENT.
113	YOU ARE AT THE EDGE OF A LARGE UNDERGROUND RESERVOIR.  AN OPAQUE CLOUD
113	OF WHITE MIST FILLS THE ROOM AND RISES RAPIDLY UPWARD.	THE LAKE IS
113	FED BY A STREAM, WHICH TUMBLES OUT OF A HOLE IN THE WALL ABOUT 10 FEET
113	OVERHEAD AND SPLASHES NOISILY INTO THE WATER SOMEWHERE WITHIN THE
113	MIST.  THE ONLY PASSAGE GOES BACK TOWARD THE SOUTH.
114	DEAD END
115	YOU ARE AT THE NORTHEAST END OF AN IMMENSE ROOM, EVEN LARGER THAN THE
115	GIANT ROOM.  IT APPEARS TO BE A REPOSITORY FOR THE "ADVENTURE"
115	PROGRAM.  MASSIVE TORCHES FAR OVERHEAD BATHE THE ROOM WITH SMOKY
115	YELLOW LIGHT.  SCATTERED ABOUT YOU CAN BE SEEN A PILE OF BOTTLES (ALL
115	OF THEM EMPTY), A NURSERY OF YOUNG BEANSTALKS MURMURING QUIETLY, A BED
115	OF OYSTERS, A BUNDLE OF BLACK RODS WITH RUSTY STARS ON THEIR ENDS, AND
115	A COLLECTION OF BRASS LANTERNS.  OFF TO ONE SIDE A GREAT MANY DWARVES
115	ARE SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR, SNORING LOUDLY.  A SIGN NEARBY READS: "DO
115	NOT DISTURB THE DWARVES!"  AN IMMENSE MIRROR IS HANGING AGAINST ONE
115	WALL, AND STRETCHES TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM, WHERE VARIOUS OTHER
115	SUNDRY OBJECTS CAN BE GLIMPSED DIMLY IN THE DISTANCE.
116	YOU ARE AT THE SOUTHWEST END OF THE REPOSITORY.  TO ONE SIDE IS A PIT
116	FULL OF FIERCE GREEN SNAKES.  ON THE OTHER SIDE IS A ROW OF SMALL
116	WICKER CAGES, EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS A LITTLE SULKING BIRD.  IN ONE
116	CORNER IS A BUNDLE OF BLACK RODS WITH RUSTY MARKS ON THEIR ENDS.  A
116	LARGE NUMBER OF VELVET PILLOWS ARE SCATTERED ABOUT ON THE FLOOR.  A
116	VAST MIRROR STRETCHES OFF TO THE NORTHEAST.  AT YOUR FEET IS A LARGE
116	STEEL GRATE, NEXT TO WHICH IS A SIGN WHICH READS, "TREASURE VAULT.
116	KEYS IN MAIN OFFICE."
117	YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF A LARGE, DEEP CHASM.  A HEAVY WHITE MIST RISING
117	UP FROM BELOW OBSCURES ALL VIEW OF THE FAR SIDE.  A SW PATH LEADS AWAY
117	FROM THE CHASM INTO A WINDING CORRIDOR.
118	YOU ARE IN A LONG WINDING CORRIDOR SLOPING OUT OF SIGHT IN BOTH
118	DIRECTIONS.
119	YOU ARE IN A SECRET CANYON WHICH EXITS TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
120	YOU ARE IN A SECRET CANYON WHICH EXITS TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
121	YOU ARE IN A SECRET CANYON WHICH EXITS TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
122	YOU ARE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE CHASM.  A NE PATH LEADS AWAY FROM THE
122	CHASM ON THIS SIDE.
123	YOU'RE IN A LONG EAST/WEST CORRIDOR.  A FAINT RUMBLING NOISE CAN BE
123	HEARD IN THE DISTANCE.
124	THE PATH FORKS HERE.  THE LEFT FORK LEADS NORTHEAST.  A DULL RUMBLING
124	SEEMS TO GET LOUDER IN THAT DIRECTION.	THE RIGHT FORK LEADS SOUTHEAST
124	DOWN A GENTLE SLOPE.  THE MAIN CORRIDOR ENTERS FROM THE WEST.
125	THE WALLS ARE QUITE WARM HERE.	FROM THE NORTH CAN BE HEARD A STEADY
125	ROAR, SO LOUD THAT THE ENTIRE CAVE SEEMS TO BE TREMBLING.  ANOTHER
125	PASSAGE LEADS SOUTH, AND A LOW CRAWL GOES EAST.
126	YOU ARE ON THE EDGE OF A BREATH-TAKING VIEW.  FAR BELOW YOU IS AN
126	ACTIVE VOLCANO, FROM WHICH GREAT GOUTS OF MOLTEN LAVA COME SURGING
126	OUT, CASCADING BACK DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS.  THE GLOWING ROCK FILLS THE
126	FARTHEST REACHES OF THE CAVERN WITH A BLOOD-RED GLARE, GIVING EVERY-
126	THING AN EERIE, MACABRE APPEARANCE.  THE AIR IS FILLED WITH FLICKERING
126	SPARKS OF ASH AND A HEAVY SMELL OF BRIMSTONE.  THE WALLS ARE HOT TO
126	THE TOUCH, AND THE THUNDERING OF THE VOLCANO DROWNS OUT ALL OTHER
126	SOUNDS.  EMBEDDED IN THE JAGGED ROOF FAR OVERHEAD ARE MYRIAD TWISTED
126	FORMATIONS COMPOSED OF PURE WHITE ALABASTER, WHICH SCATTER THE MURKY
126	LIGHT INTO SINISTER APPARITIONS UPON THE WALLS.  TO ONE SIDE IS A DEEP
126	GORGE, FILLED WITH A BIZARRE CHAOS OF TORTURED ROCK WHICH SEEMS TO
126	HAVE BEEN CRAFTED BY THE DEVIL HIMSELF.  AN IMMENSE RIVER OF FIRE
126	CRASHES OUT FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE VOLCANO, BURNS ITS WAY THROUGH THE
126	GORGE, AND PLUMMETS INTO A BOTTOMLESS PIT FAR OFF TO YOUR LEFT.  TO
126	THE RIGHT, AN IMMENSE GEYSER OF BLISTERING STEAM ERUPTS CONTINUOUSLY
126	FROM A BARREN ISLAND IN THE CENTER OF A SULFUROUS LAKE, WHICH BUBBLES
126	OMINOUSLY.  THE FAR RIGHT WALL IS AFLAME WITH AN INCANDESCENCE OF ITS
126	OWN, WHICH LENDS AN ADDITIONAL INFERNAL SPLENDOR TO THE ALREADY
126	HELLISH SCENE.	A DARK, FOREBODING PASSAGE EXITS TO THE SOUTH.
127	YOU ARE IN A SMALL CHAMBER FILLED WITH LARGE BOULDERS.	THE WALLS ARE
127	VERY WARM, CAUSING THE AIR IN THE ROOM TO BE ALMOST STIFLING FROM THE
127	HEAT.  THE ONLY EXIT IS A CRAWL HEADING WEST, THROUGH WHICH IS COMING
127	A LOW RUMBLING.
128	YOU ARE WALKING ALONG A GENTLY SLOPING NORTH/SOUTH PASSAGE LINED WITH
128	ODDLY SHAPED LIMESTONE FORMATIONS.
129	YOU ARE STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE TO A LARGE, BARREN ROOM.  A SIGN
129	POSTED ABOVE THE ENTRANCE READS:  "CAUTION!  BEAR IN ROOM!"
130	YOU ARE INSIDE A BARREN ROOM.  THE CENTER OF THE ROOM IS COMPLETELY
130	EMPTY EXCEPT FOR SOME DUST.  MARKS IN THE DUST LEAD AWAY TOWARD THE
130	FAR END OF THE ROOM.  THE ONLY EXIT IS THE WAY YOU CAME IN.
131	YOU ARE IN A MAZE OF TWISTING LITTLE PASSAGES, ALL DIFFERENT.
132	YOU ARE IN A LITTLE MAZE OF TWISTY PASSAGES, ALL DIFFERENT.
